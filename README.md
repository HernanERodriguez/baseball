# baseball
An upcoming web-based tool for sabermetrics.

The idea is to have an open-source tool that can leverage free data sources from across the Web, and make them available via a "nice" interface.

I just want the chance to do something cool with baseball, big data, and AWS as a side project. If anyone wants to help, let me know!

The code here will remain open-source and Apache v2-licensed. The product will also be hosted on the Web, if I can afford it.
