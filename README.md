# baseball
An upcoming web-based tool for sabermetrics.

The idea is to have a tool that can leverage free data sources from across the Web, and make them available via a "nice" interface.

I just want the chance to do something cool with baseball, big data, and AWS as a side project. If anyone wants to help, let me know!
