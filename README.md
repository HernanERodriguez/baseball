# Baseball Workbench
Baseball Workbench is an upcoming Web-based tool for Sabermetrics research.

The software for Baseball Workbench will be open-source, and will integrate with freely available data sources.

The hosted tool will have associated infrastructure costs, but we may look to offset these with sponsors,
ads, or fees at some point.

## Release Date
The "Alpha" version of Baseball Workbench will be released by MLB Opening Day 2017 (April 2).
